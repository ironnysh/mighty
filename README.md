# Mighty Eleventy Starter

![screenshot: a demo of Mighty used for a fake hair salon](mighty-demo-screenshot.webp)
## Summary

Mighty is my attempt at using [Eleventy (11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev) to build a sort of Single Page Application (SPA) - a simple, elegant theme from which freelancers or small businesses can generate simple one-pagers.

[See a demo of the site.](https://mighty-site.vercel.app)

## Features

- Responsive layout (no media queries).
- Minimal architecture: vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CCS3 - no external build tools.
- Advanced SEO: [Open Graph]( https://ogp.me/) meta tags for social share on Facebook and Twitter and [JSON-LD]( https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data) schema for search engines.
- Lite YouTube JavaScript that loads videos embedded from YouTube only when the user clicks.
- Automatically optimized images.
- Minified code.
- Maximized performance.
- Semantic and accessible markup.
- Supports RTL layout.
- Cache and security configuration.

## Getting started

* If this is your first time working with Eleventy, static site generators (SSG), GitHub, or Node, it might be a good idea to start with [Tatiana Mac's comprehensive tutorial](https://www.tatianamac.com/posts/beginner-eleventy-tutorial-partii/). The multi-part series is titled __Beginner's Guide to Eleventy__, but it's packed with incredibly useful information about all things web-dev. Highly recommended read.

### 1. Clone this repository and install the project dependencies
Copy the following command and paste it into your device's terminal to create a local copy of the site and install the project dependencies. Change `your-project-name` to your site's name.

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ironnysh/mighty.git your-project-name
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

**Or**

### 1.1 Generate a repository from the template
Click the green `use this template` button on the top to generate a repository under your GitHub account and copy all files into your new project.

### 1.2 Create a local copy and install the project dependencies
Copy the following command and paste it into your device's terminal to create a local copy of the site and install the project dependencies. Change `your-project-name` to your site's name.

```
cd your-project-name
npm install
```

### 2. Run Eleventy
#### Locally
Copy the following command and paste it into your device's terminal to generate a local copy of the site in the `www` directory. The files automatically update whenever you make changes to the files:
```
npm start
```
Open your browser and type `http://localhost:8080` in the address bar to see your site.

#### Hosting
When you're ready to deploy your site to a hosting provider, copy and paste the following command in your preferred hosting platform's settings section. It will generate a remote copy of the site in the `www` directory (*note: this also needs to be specified on Vercel. See the screenshot below).
```
npm run build
```
[Vercel](https://vercel.com) is my preferred hosting provider, but you can use any other service that supports static sites, including [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Render](https://render.com), and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com),

Click this button to host your site on Vercel:

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/ironnysh/mighty.git)

This is what you should use after clicking the button - note the override of the default OUTPUT DIRECTORY:

## Customize and edit the content, color schemes, and fonts

### Edit the content
There are three files to edit (see the [File overview](#file-overview) below for details):
1. `src/_data/settings.json` - change the values to the right of the colon of each key. E.g., `url` should be your site's address, `author` should be your name, `phoneNumber` should be your number (change `phoneCall` accordingly, keeping the format to allow tap-to-call on mobile), etc. This is also where you can change the labels of the top navigation. E.g., `products` and `work` instead of `services` and `portfolio`.
3. `src/_data/content.json` - text displayed on the homepage: title and paragraphs of the About section; titles and summaries of the Services section; titles, summaries, and video IDs for the Portfolio; and privacy policy references. You can change the values to the right of the colon of the `title`, `summary`, and `videoID` keys. Unless you plan to add an analytics service, you can leave the privacy section as-is.
4. `src/imprint.md` - your personal details and contact information (Masthead) are generated automatically based on the details provided in the `_data/settings.json`. Unless you plan to add analytics or other tracking services, you can leave the Data Protection and GDPR sections as-is. The other privacy references on the page are generated automatically based on the information provided in the privacy section of the `_data/content.json`. You can update the relevant credits under the Colophon according to your sources.

*Note: you can safely delete this `README` file, as well `subset-google_fonts.webp`, `delpoy-to-vercel.webp`, and `mighty-demo-screenshot.webp` - they're here to help you set up the site.

### Change colors and fonts
Open `src/_includes/utilities/style.css` and edit any CSS attribute you'd like.
The most relevant parts are probably the colors and fonts:
1. All the colors are defined as CSS variables on the top. Change the `hsl` values to the color scheme you want.
2. There are three fonts in use (see the [File overview](#file-overview) below). If you delete or replace any of them, update the references in two places: the `@font-face` rules at the top and the `font-family` variable. There are fallback system fonts for each.
**Important**: for better performance, the fonts are preloaded in the `head` of the main layout (`src/_includes/layouts/default.njk`) - delete or update these lines according to the fonts you use.

### Contact icons
The SVG files of the icons can be replaced, and you can also add others. For example, Instagram instead of Twitter (*note that the current design accommodates only three icons).

You can either include a new SVG file in `src/_includes/svg` or paste the code directly into the existing file. If you add a new file of a service that doesn't exist (For example, Instagram), provide your relevant details in `src/_data/settings.json` and update it accordingly in the code (it's recommended to use the `Find and Replace` option in your code editor).

### Replace images and fonts
The `src/assets` folder includes all the non-code files: fonts, images, and favicon. You can replace these with your graphics and fonts. Please note: if you decide to change the names of the images, update them accordingly in the code (it's recommended to use the `Find and Replace` option in your code editor).

## Tips
**Language**: For a non-US English site, set the language in the first line of `src/_data/settings.json`. Check out the [complete list of language and country codes](https://www.fincher.org/Utilities/CountryLanguageList.shtml) and copy the appropriate one. Setting it to Hebrew (he-IL) does require other fonts, but the layout will automatically change to right-to-left (RTL).

**Social Image**: you can use a service like [Thumbnail.AI](https://thumbnail.ai) to generate a social image.

**Optimize Fonts**: _Fredericka the great_ is quite a large font file, even when limited to the Latin alphabet. You can optimize it further by downloading a "leaner" version of it from Google Fonts. Follow these steps:
1. Copy the line below:
```
https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Fredericka+the+Great&text=YOUR-LETTERS-HERE
```
2. Replace the `YOUR-LETTERS-HERE` after the equals sign (`=`) with the letters you need for the heading (currently "Every Story is Interesting if you Know How to Tell it") making sure you don't repeat any letter. I.e., `EveryStoisIngfuKwHTl` for the sentence above.
3. Paste the whole URL into your browser address bar (the Google Fonts link and your letters) and hit `Enter`.
4. You'll see a plain HTML page with a few lines of code. Copy the part inside the parentheses after `src: url` - see the yellow line in the screenshot:

![screenshot: CSS code of a subsetted font from Google Fonts](subset-google_fonts.webp)

5. Paste this URL you copied into your browser address bar, hit `Enter`, and save the optimized font file to your device.
6. Rename the downloaded file to `fredericka-the-great-subset`, copy it, and paste it into your site's `src/assets` folder to replace the current file.

This might seem daunting or a waste of time, but it's less complicated than it might look and is definitely worth it. For example , the `EveryStoisIngfuKwHTl` subset version of the font is **36 kb** instead of **110 kb**! Major performance gains for you and your site's visitors.

## Epilogue
I started working on the first version of this project around April 2020, when Corona came to town, and the world suddenly stopped. I had just discovered a thing called Eleventy, "a simpler static site generator." (The developer, [Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat), wasn't lying.)

Soon after I started tinkering with it, I noticed Eleventy had a nice side effect: it brought back the joy of building sites.

Now, after (gradually) overcoming my impostor syndrome, I want to give back to this incredible community (open source in general, and [Eleventy](https://discord.com/invite/GBkBy9u) in particular): I'm releasing this project under [MIT/CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License](LICENSE).

Have fun, and I hope you find it interesting and valuable.
